             <span style="font-size:14px;">"MUJI" was founded in Japan, and its original meaning is "no trademark and high quality". Although trying to downplay the brand awareness, the products produced by it follow the unified design concept all interpret the brand image of "MUJI". The natural, simple and simple lifestyle it advocates is also highly praised by people with taste. <br /><br />
                One of the biggest characteristics of MUJI is minimalism. Its products have removed the trademark, unnecessary design, and all unnecessary processing and color, so simple that only the material and function itself remain. In addition to the logo on store signs and paper bags, it is difficult for customers to find its brand mark on all Muji products. In MUJI stores, except for the red "MUJI" box, customers can hardly see any bright colors, and the main colors of most products are white, beige, blue or black. <br /><br />
                In product development, MUJI has set strict regulations on design, raw materials, and prices. For example, clothing should strictly abide by the design principles of no pattern, plaid, and stripes, and only use black and white, brown, blue, etc. in color. No matter how popular the popular colors of the year are, they will never go beyond the design principles to develop products. <br /><br />
                For the sake of environmental protection and consumer health, MUJI stipulates that many materials should not be used, such as PVC, Teflon, stevia, sorbic acid, etc. On the packaging, its style is mostly transparent and translucent, as simple as possible. Muji has also won over environmentalists, thanks to its emphasis on environmentally friendly recycled materials and its simplicity of packaging to the bare essentials. In addition, MUJI never conducts commercial advertisements, as Kiuchi Masao said: "We have absorbed the ideas of top designers and avant-garde concepts in product design, which has played the role of excellent advertisements. The products we produce It is accepted by different consumer groups, which also plays a publicity role for us."<br /><br />
                The company integrates dealers and manufacturers of interior software of various styles and brands, involving modern style, Chinese style, new Chinese style, Shanghai style, Art Deco style, neoclassical, French, European style, etc., with a variety of styles of lamps, furniture, wallpaper , cloth art and jewelry cooperation resources, and also covers various types of art decoration and custom enterprises; there are professional designers in home decoration design. Some people think that Muji is not so much a brand as it is a way of life philosophy. It does not emphasize the so-called popularity, but restores the true meaning of the commodity value at an ordinary price, and sublimates the product to the cultural level in the seemingly invisible design. Today, MUJI's product categories have reached about 6,000, and the internationally renowned financial magazine "Forbes" once rated it as the world's best medium-sized company. </span>
