             <span style="font-size:14px;">"MUJI" was founded in Japan, and its original meaning is "no trademark and high quality". Although trying to downplay the brand awareness, the products produced by it follow the unified design concept all interpret the brand image of "MUJI". The natural, simple and simple lifestyle it advocates is also highly praised by people with taste. <br /><br />
                In 1980, the world economic growth fell into a downturn, and Japan also experienced a serious energy crisis. Consumers at that time not only demanded good quality products, but also hoped that prices would be favorable. In this case, the concept of "no brand" was born in Japan. That year, Kiuchi Masao founded the "MUJI" company and launched the first batch of unbranded products to the market. These products are packaged cleanly, cost is reduced and the slogan used is "value for money". <br /><br />
                In 1983, MUJI opened its first flagship store in Aoyama, Tokyo. Due to the great affirmation of consumers, there are hundreds of specialty stores in Japan within a few years. In 1991, MUJI opened its first overseas store in London, and then successively entered France, Sweden, Italy, Norway, Ireland and other countries. In July 2005, its Shanghai store officially opened. <br /><br />
                On July 24, 2015, MUJI, the parent company of Japan's "MUJI", decided to reduce the prices of about 260 categories of clothing sold in China by an average of 20% after August 2015. Although China's stock market has fluctuated recently and the economic slowdown is also worrying, the performance of Liangpin Project in China is still good. The operating income from March to May of 2015 increased by 90% year-on-year. </span>
