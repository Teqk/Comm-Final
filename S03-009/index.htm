        <div class="part1_body"><div style="line-height: 24px;">
	<div>
		<span style="font-size:13px;">“MUJI" was founded in Japan, and its original meaning is "no trademark and high quality". Although it tries its best to downplay the brand awareness, the products produced by it follow the unified design concept all interpret the brand image of "MUJI". The natural, simple and simple lifestyle it advocates is also highly praised by people of taste.</span><br />
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		<span style="font-size:13px;">In 1980, the world economic growth fell into a downturn, and Japan also experienced a serious energy crisis. Consumers at that time not only demanded good quality products, but also hoped that prices would be favorable. In this case, the concept of "no brand" was born in Japan. That year, Kiuchi Masao founded the "MUJI" company and launched the first batch of unbranded products to the market. These products are packaged cleanly, cost is reduced and the slogan used is "value for money".</span><br />
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		<span style="font-size:13px;">In 1983, MUJI opened its first flagship store in Aoyama, Tokyo. Due to the great affirmation of consumers, there are hundreds of specialty stores in Japan within a few years. In 1991, MUJI opened its first overseas store in London, and then successively entered France, Sweden, Italy, Norway, Ireland and other countries. In July 2005, its Shanghai store officially opened.</span></div>
		<div>
		<span style="font-size:13px;">On July 24, 2015, MUJI, the parent company of Japan's "MUJI", decided to reduce the prices of about 260 categories of clothing sold in China by an average of 20% after August 2015. Although China's stock market has fluctuated recently and the economic slowdown is also worrying, the performance of Liangpin Project in China is still good. The operating income from March to May of 2015 increased by 90% year-on-year.</span></div>

    <div class="part1 clear clr mt3">
        <div class="part1_top">无印良品 MUJI & Features</div>
        <div class="part1_body"><span style="font-size:13px;">One of the biggest characteristics of MUJI is minimalism. Its products have removed the trademark, unnecessary design, and all unnecessary processing and color, so simple that only the material and function itself remain. In addition to the logo on store signs and paper bags, it is difficult for customers to find its brand mark on all Muji products. In MUJI stores, except for the red "MUJI" box, customers can hardly see any bright colors, and the main colors of most products are white, beige, blue or black.</span></div>
		  <div class="part1_body"><span style="font-size:13px;">In product development, MUJI has set strict regulations on design, raw materials, and prices. For example, clothing should strictly abide by the design principles of no pattern, plaid, and stripes, and only use black and white, brown, blue, etc. in color. No matter how popular the popular colors of the year are, they will never go beyond the design principles to develop products.</span></div>
		   <div class="part1_body"><span style="font-size:13px;">For the sake of environmental protection and consumer health, MUJI stipulates that many materials should not be used, such as PVC, Teflon, stevia, sorbic acid, etc. On the packaging, its style is mostly transparent and translucent, as simple as possible. Muji has also won over environmentalists, thanks to its emphasis on environmentally friendly recycled materials and its simplicity of packaging to the bare essentials. In addition, MUJI never conducts commercial advertisements, as Kiuchi Masao said: "We have absorbed the ideas of top designers and avant-garde concepts in product design, which has played the role of excellent advertisements. The products we produce It is accepted by different consumer groups, which also plays a role in publicity for us.”</span></div>
		    <div class="part1_body"><span style="font-size:13px;">Some people think that Muji is not so much a brand as it is a philosophy of life. It does not emphasize the so-called popularity, but restores the true meaning of the commodity value at an ordinary price, and sublimates the product to the cultural level in the seemingly invisible design. Today, MUJI's product categories have reached about 6,000, and the internationally renowned financial magazine "Forbes" once rated it as the world's best medium-sized company.</span></div>
